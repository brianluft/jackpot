Jackpot is a Windows app for storing your media collection in S3-compatible cloud storage and streaming it to your computer.

<img src="img/main-screenshot.jpg" width=640 height=360>

## Features

- Direct streaming from cloud storage. No intermediate server needed.
- Flexible tagging and filtering.
- Browse through a wall of moving video thumbnails.
- Stream movies using the VLC player. Stream multiple videos at once, if you want.
- Fullscreen, mouse-driven user interface featuring action buttons along the edges of the screen, following [Fitts's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law).
- Export your library as a folder of `.m3u8` playlist files for use with VLC on tvOS/iOS and other computers on your local network that don't have Jackpot. They will stream through Jackpot running on your main computer.
- End-to-end encryption using standard AES-encrypted `.zip` files.

## Pricing

The Jackpot app is free, but you need an account with an S3-compatible cloud storage provider.
You'll pay them each month per terabyte of storage.
Some providers also charge per gigabyte downloaded ("egress") beyond a certain allotment per month.
Uploads to the cloud are always free.
