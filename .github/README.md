## Requirements

- Windows 10 (version 20H1) or higher
- S3-compatible cloud storage account
- Internet speed: 20&nbsp;Mbps per 1080p stream
- Video files in MP4 format (Jackpot does not reencode videos)

## Alternatives

A USB drive is the simplest solution for most users: affordable, fast, and works offline. Media server software like [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), [Emby](https://emby.media/index.html), and [Plex Media Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_Inc.#Plex_Media_Server) can provide streaming and organization features. These are mature platforms with large communities, though they focus on commercial TV shows and movies and require technical knowledge to set up.

Consumer cloud storage like [OneDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive) and [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox) offer video streaming, but they transcode videos to lower quality, have slow startup times, and lack native player integration. They can be convenient for small personal collections, but they don't provide end-to-end encryption and can be cumbersome for large libraries.

Jackpot aims for a middle ground: direct streaming from cheap cloud storage with end-to-end encryption, no quality loss, and minimal setup.
